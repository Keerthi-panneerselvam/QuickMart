Perfect! I've created a **comprehensive database schema** for QuickMart with the following features:

## ðŸ“Š Database Structure:

### **6 Service Databases:**

1. **User Service** (4 tables)
   - users, addresses, wishlist, user_preferences

2. **Product Service** (6 tables)
   - categories, brands, stores, products, product_inventory, product_reviews

3. **Order Service** (4 tables)
   - cart, orders, order_items, order_status_history

4. **Payment Service** (5 tables)
   - payments, refunds, payment_methods, offers, offer_usage

5. **Notification Service** (1 table)
   - notifications

6. **Location Service** (2 tables)
   - delivery_zones, delivery_partners

### **Key Features:**

âœ… **22 Core Tables** with proper relationships
âœ… **Foreign Keys & Constraints** for data integrity
âœ… **Indexes** on frequently queried columns for performance
âœ… **Triggers** for auto-updating timestamps and ratings
âœ… **Check Constraints** for data validation
âœ… **Generated Columns** (discount_percentage)
âœ… **JSONB Fields** for flexible data (operating hours, nutritional info)
âœ… **Array Types** for image URLs, highlights, categories
âœ… **Views** for reporting (daily stats, product performance, user summary)
âœ… **Audit Trails** (order status history, user activity logs)
âœ… **Comprehensive Comments** for documentation

### **Advanced Features:**

- Calculated discount percentages
- Inventory management with reserved quantities
- Order status timeline tracking
- Product rating auto-calculation
- Single default address enforcement
- Multi-channel notifications
- Delivery zone polygon coordinates
- User activity logging for analytics

Would you like me to create:
1. **Spring Boot entities** matching this schema?
2. **Repository interfaces** with custom queries?
3. **Migration scripts** (Flyway/Liquibase)?
4. **Sample data seeding scripts**?
